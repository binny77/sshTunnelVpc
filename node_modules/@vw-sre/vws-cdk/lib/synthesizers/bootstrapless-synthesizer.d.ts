 * Synthesizer to deploy a stack in a non-bootstrapped environment.

 * A common finding when using CDK is the usage of the AdministratorAccess policy.
 * One way to avoid using it is to provide `--cloudformation-execution-policies`.
 * Using AWS managed policies is not always wanted.
 *
 * This synthesizer provides a workaround for https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/16888
